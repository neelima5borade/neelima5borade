## Hi, Neelima here 👋

- I am a mathematics PhD candidate, quantitative finance enthusiast, and aspiring quant researcher.
- I have been working on independent  projects to gain familiarity with quantiative modeling and generating insights from models
- This Fall I put together a final project for the Erdos Institute's Quant Finance Bootcamp in which I am currently enrolled, where I compared the performance of GARCH(1,1) and SV (with particle filter) across multiple assets and shock periods.
