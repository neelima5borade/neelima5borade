## Hi, Neelima here 👋

- I am a mathematics PhD candidate and quantitative finance enthusiast 
- I have been working on some independent incremental 'baby' projects to gain familiarity with quantiative modeling and generating insights from models
- This Fall I put together a final project for the Erdos Institute's Quant Finance Bootcamp in which I am currently enrolled
